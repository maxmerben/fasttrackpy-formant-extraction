# fasttrackpy-formant-extraction
A simple Jupyter Notebook script to extract formants from a folder with audio files and textgrids using the `fasttrackpy` module (**[link](https://github.com/FastTrackiverse/fasttrackpy)**)

- a general pipeline for formants’ extraction
- works on folders with data for individual speakers
- handles `fasttrackpy`’s unfortunate problems with non-ASCII characters in file names
- generates a csv file with the optimal formants
